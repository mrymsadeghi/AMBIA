## Best Practices for Applying the AMBIA Tool

When considering the application of the AMBIA tool for localizing and registering 2D histological mouse brain images in 3D atlas space, it is important to follow best practices to ensure optimal results and effective utilization of the tool. Here, we outline some key best practices for researchers and practitioners:

### Data preparation and quality control: 
Ensure that the input histological images are of high quality, as artifacts and distortions can affect the performance of the localization and registration modules. Proper tissue preparation, staining, and scanning procedures should be followed to minimize the introduction of artifacts.

### Understand limitations: 
Be aware of the limitations of the AMBIA tool, such as the higher error in detecting the β angle compared to the α angle, and consider the potential impact on your research findings. Understanding these limitations will help you interpret the results more accurately.

### Use the graphical user interface (GUI): 
To facilitate ease of use and minimize errors, utilize the GUI provided by the AMBIA tool. This will help researchers with minimal programming knowledge to effectively apply the tool in practice.

### Integration with other analysis methods: 
The modular design of the AMBIA tool allows for the integration of various cell detection methods through the use of a placeholder module in the pipeline. Be sure to explore and integrate the most suitable cell detection method for your specific research needs.

### Validation and comparison: 
When using the AMBIA tool, validate the results against manual annotations or other benchmark methods to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the localization and registration outcomes. This will help you better understand the performance of the tool in your specific context.

### Adapting the tool for different modalities: 
While the current study focuses on histological MBIs, the methods have the potential to be applied to other modalities and domains. Researchers should explore the possibility of adapting the AMBIA tool for use with different imaging techniques and modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

### Continuous updates and improvements: 
Keep track of any updates and improvements to the AMBIA tool to ensure that you are using the most up-to-date version with the latest features and enhancements. This will help you achieve the best possible results in your research.

### Collaborate and share findings: 
Collaborate with other researchers who are using the AMBIA tool to exchange insights, best practices, and findings. Sharing experiences and knowledge will help improve the overall understanding of the tool and contribute to its ongoing development and refinement.
